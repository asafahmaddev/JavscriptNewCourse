            <h1>window onload</h1>

            <p>
                In JavaScript, window.onload is an event handler that executes a function when the entire content
                of a page (including images, scripts, and stylesheets) has finished loading.
                This is useful for running code that relies on the DOM being fully loaded
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternative: DOMContentLoaded For cases where you want to execute
                code as soon as the DOM is fully loaded and parse without waiting for stylesheets, images,
                and subframes to finish loading, you can use the DOMContentLoaded event.
                It fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed:
            </p>
